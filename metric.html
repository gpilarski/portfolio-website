            <p>Metric Weather is a responsive web application designed to help water sports enthusiasts maximize their time on the water.</p>
            <p>The aim of the app is to provide the exact forecast that every user wants. Users have the ability to edit the metrics that appear in their forecast so that they see the information they want, and none that they don't/</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>My Process</h1>
            <p>The very first thing I did to determine the direction Metric Weather should go was conduct a competitive analysis. This would help me determine what the existing market was like to find the gap that my app could fill.</p>
            <div><!--competitive analysis-->
                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>I conducted a competitive UX analysis on two existing weather apps, one general marine weather app and one sport specific app, to more fully understand the market.</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>General Marine Weather App</h3>
                    <p>This app's goal is the provide accurate wave, wind, and weather forecasts along with easy easy to read charts. They emphasize their "professionally designed UI/UX" and user friendly app.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accurate forecasts</li>
                        <li>Provides essential forecast data without any walls of text or numbers</li>
                        <li>Ability to search specific stations or recommend new ones</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>General information covers lots of needs</li>
                            <li>Clean UI makes information easy to read</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lacks in-depth details for professionals</li>
                            <li>Some big features are behind a paywall</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Opportunities</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>UI has room for aesthetic and accessability improvement</li>
                            <li>App has no flexibility to match user needs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Threats</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many apps have more sport specific information</li>
                            <li>All information is available on website</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Sport Specific App</h3>
                    <p>This app's goal is  make it easy for surfers to find out what the conditions are at locations near them so they can decide where and when to surf.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accurate forecasts and live updates for almost 3,000 locations in 180 countries</li>
                        <li>Forecast charts in addition to reports made by real surfers</li>
                        <li>Ability to access live web-cams to view the locations you are reading about</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Covers all needed surf information</li>
                            <li>Visually easy to read</li>
                            <li>Dedicated user base</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Design has room for improvement</li>
                            <li>"Less information" option in app removes very little</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Opportunities</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>UNot available on iPad</li>
                            <li>Can offer longer term forecast free (instead of subscription)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Threats</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Other large competitors like Surfline offer all the same services</li>
                            <li>Poor reviews in Google Play store may lose them users</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>From my analysis I made two discoveries:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>General weather apps lack the details or flexibility needed to give experts a complete weather forecast</li>
                    <li>Sport specific apps had a very large amount of information but no way to limit the amount of information you can see</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From these discoveries I realized that I wanted Metric Weather to be a flexible app that could fit the needs of beginners and experts, as well as single sport or multi-sport athletes.</p>
            </div>
            <div><!--problem statement-->
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>After conducting a competitive analysis, interviews with water sports enthusiasts, and hypothesis testing this is what I came up with:</p>
                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>Existing water sport forecast apps specialize in one sport or in providing general forecasts that lack metrics experts need. Sport beginners can be overwhelmed with data, while sport experts may desire extra information an app cannot provide. Both of these can lead to dangerous mistakes that affect safety.</p>
                <h3>The Solution:</h3>
                <p>Water sport enthusiasts need a way to accurately gauge water and weather statistics based on their personal skill level. We will know this to be true when less than 5% of users who engage with this app report that the weather differ from our forecast.</p>
            </div>
            <div><!--user research findings-->
                <h2>User Research Findings</h2>
                <p>I conducted interviews with three water sports enthusiasts to understand their behaviors, needs, and pain points. After an affinity map and analysis here are my findings.</p>

                    <source srcset="#" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="#" alt="#">
                </picture>
                <h3>Findings that supportet my problem statement:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weather metrics needed varies by sport and by experience level</li>
                    <li>Most interviewees use more than one app/website to get data</li>
                    <li>Interviewees trust what they can see and know their own limits.  Experience level changes needs</li>
                    <li>Interviewees want to maximize their time on the water and get the most out of that time</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Findings that led to user persona 1 (Jeff):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some users trust their own eyes over any application or advisory</li>
                    <li>Some users go to a different locations all over the world for their sport</li>
                    <li>Some users like to plan trips just to do a sport</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Findings that led to user persona 2 (Sabrina):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some users trust advisories and applications over their own judgement</li>
                    <li>Some users can only do their sport from one main location</li>
                    <li>Some users can only do their sport sporadically</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div><!--user personas-->
                <p>Based on my interviews with water sports enthusiasts I created two user personas:</p>

            <div><!--mental models-->
                <h2>Mental Models</h2>
                <p>I then created mental models to demonstrate how they would feel while using the app.</p>
