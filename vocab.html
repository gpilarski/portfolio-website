            <p>Vocab Recall was my first venture into UX and UI design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h1 id="headline">My Process</h1>
            <p>The very first thing I did to determine the direction I wanted to take Vocab Recall was to conduct interviews with users of other flashcard and language study apps.</p>
            <div><!--user research-->
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I conducted interviews with three people who each studied different languages on multiple different apps.</p>
                <p>From these interviews my main takeaways were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users of flashcard apps are not brand new to the language</li>
                    <li>Users prefer shorter study sessions available anywhere</li>
                    <li>Users do not like seeing words they already know</li>
                    <li>Users have language goals: learn slang, learn workplace terms, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From these discoveries I realized that I wanted Metric Weather to be a flexible app that could fit the needs of beginners and experts, as well as single sport or multi-sport athletes.</p>

                <p>From the data I collected I created my user persona, Nicholas.</p>

We will know this to be true when we see nicholas customize the vocabulary he is learning to match his personal goals and skill level; and hypothesis statement: We believe that by providing many premade and customizable flashcard sets for Nicholas we will achieve the most effective and targeted learning cirriculum.">

                <ul>
                    <li>Create a new vocab set from scratch</li>

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <p>This case study was an interesting and informative introduction to UX design for me. I learned a lot about the research and testing required to make an effective app, as well as the importance of conducting multiple rounds of testing. This project was my introduction to user centered design and I realized how important that focus is in every step of the process. If I were to continue working on Vocab Recall my next steps would be to increase prototype fidelity and then undergo another round of usability testing. While I did not continue to work on this project, I took all the lessons I learned to my next project, Metric Weather.</p>
